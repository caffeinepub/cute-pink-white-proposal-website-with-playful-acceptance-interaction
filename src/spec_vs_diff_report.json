  "summary": "REQ-14 appears addressed by adding a new production domain value \"for-my-yellow\". The diff adds frontend-side asset URL handling and error boundary changes that may help runtime robustness, but it does not provide evidence that the generic production deployment error (REQ-15) is actually identified/fixed, nor that the required static assets are present at the specified paths (REQ-16). Additionally, backend/main.mo was replaced with an empty actor, which was not requested and may be risky given the architecture constraints.",

      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Investigate and fix the generic \"Production deployment error: Deployment error\" by identifying the failing step and correcting the underlying issue so the current Version 3 build can successfully deploy to production.",
      "reason": "The diff shows frontend robustness changes (ErrorBoundary, asset URL helper) and a domain text file, but does not show any concrete deployment pipeline/config fix or evidence of the failing step being identified/corrected to ensure production deployment succeeds.",

Fix any missing/incorrect paths or missing files.",
      "reason": "The diff updates code to build asset URLs via a new helper and references the mascot and MP3 via assetUrl(), but does not add/modify the actual asset files under a public/assets directory, nor does it show the hero photo reference being verified/fixed (ProposalPage asking-state section is truncated).",
